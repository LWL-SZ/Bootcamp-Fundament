# Glossary (edited by lqm)
--------------------
## 1. artificial neural networks(ANNs):
`
  ANN refers to a complex network structure formed by a large number of processing units (neurons) connected to each other.It is an abstraction, simplification and simulation of the structure and operation mechanism of human brain tissue.
`

## 2. ventral visual stream
`
  The ventral stream, commonly referred as the "what" stream, is involved in the recognition, identification and categorization of visual stimuli.
`  

## 3. V4 neural sites
`
  The V4 neural sites, commonly referred as mid-level cortical stages of ventral visual stream，is a part of the visual stream system in primate brain that can separate objects from their background.
`

## 4. receptive fields
`
  The region of stimulation that a neuron responds to is called the receptive field of the neuron.
`

## 5. inferior temporal cortex
`
  The inferior temporal cortex, commonly referred as high-level cortical stages of ventral visual stream, is a part of the visual stream system in primate brain that contains many visual neurons thought to be involved in identifying specific objects.
`

## 6. fMRI
`
  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) is an emerging neuroimaging method that uses magnetic resonance imaging to measure changes in hemodynamics caused by neuronal activity. Due to the non-invasiveness, non-radiative exposure problems of fMRI and its wide application, it has occupied a place in the field of brain function positioning since the 1990s. At present, it is mainly used to study the brain or spinal cord of humans and animals.
`

## 7. microelectrode array
`
  The microelectrode array can simultaneously record the extracellular field potential signals at multiple sites. The electrodes can also be used as stimulation or grounding. The microelectrode array is suitable for the study of electrophysiological properties and ion channel biological characteristics of nerves, retinas and cardiomyocytes.
`
## 8. cross-validation
`
  Cross-validation is a common method used in machine learning to build models and validate model parameters. Cross-validation, as the name implies, is the repeated use of data, segmentation of the obtained sample data, combined into different training sets and validation sets, training model with training sets, and using the validation set to evaluate the performance of the model. On this basis, multiple sets of different training sets and validation sets can be obtained. A sample in a training set may become a sample in the validation set next time, which is called “cross”.
`

## 9. luminous power pattern
`
  The luminous power pattern is colloquially referred to as systhesised image stimulation.
`

## 10. softmax
`
  Softmax regression (or multinomial logistic regression) is a generalization of logistic regression to the case where we want to handle multiple classes. In logistic regression we assumed that the labels were binary: y(i)∈{0,1}. We used such a classifier to distinguish between two kinds of hand-written digits. Softmax regression allows us to handle y(i)∈{1,…,K} where K is the number of classes. The softmax score is calculated by softmax function to measure the performance of neuron network model typically.
